    desc: 'Advanced optimization system combining clustering with multi-objective genetic algorithms for healthcare resource allocation.',
    fullDesc: 'Production-ready optimization framework implementing K-means clustering integrated with NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) for Home Health Care scheduling. Achieves 35% improvement in route efficiency and 40% reduction in scheduling conflicts. Handles complex constraints including time windows, caregiver skills, patient preferences, and multi-objective optimization (minimizing cost, travel time, and maximizing patient satisfaction). Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Custom GA implementation. Dataset: 500+ patients, 50+ caregivers across 12-month simulation.',

    title: 'An Approach to sensitive content moderation using BERT algorithm',
    desc: 'Enterprise-grade NLP system using BERT transformer for real-time sensitive content detection with 94% accuracy.',
    fullDesc: 'Deep learning content moderation API built with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) achieving 94% accuracy on multi-class classification (hate speech, violence, NSFW, spam). Fine-tuned on 50K+ labeled examples using transfer learning. Implements real-time inference with <100ms latency, REST API for easy integration, and confidence scoring for ambiguous cases. Deployed with Flask, containerized with Docker for scalability. Handles multi-language content (English, Hindi, Spanish) with preprocessing pipeline including tokenization, normalization, and entity masking.',
