I wanted to reach out because I built [Your Project Name], which I believe could be a valuable addition to [Target Project]. Here's why:

**What it does:**
[1-2 sentence description of your project's purpose and unique value]

**Why it might fit [Target Project]:**
- [Specific reason #1 — e.g., "Solves a common problem your community faces"]
- [Specific reason #2 — e.g., "Demonstrates [specific technique] not covered in existing entries"]
- [Specific reason #3 — e.g., "Open source with comprehensive documentation"]

**Technical Details:**

- Key Features: [2-3 bullet points]
- Performance: [1 notable metric if applicable]

**Links:**

3. **Be concise** — Busy maintainers appreciate brevity
4. **No pressure** — Make it easy to say "no" gracefully
